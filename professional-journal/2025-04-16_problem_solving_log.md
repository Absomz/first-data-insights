## üí° Problem-Solving Scenario

During a multiple-choice matching exercise on feasibility study types, the problem provided direct clues within the statements themselves. Instead of relying solely on memorization, logical reasoning based on keyword association was applied to select the correct answers.

## üß† Analytical Insight

This case reaffirms an essential principle in technical problem-solving:

> **Sometimes the very structure of a problem contains implicit hints to its own solution.**

By analyzing context, terminology, and logical relationships, one can often deduce the correct answer even without recalling the exact lesson text. This technique is especially valuable in environments where deep understanding and interpretation outweigh surface-level recall.

## üîç Example Breakdown

- **"Schedule"** relates logically to **time estimation**, matching directly with **project timeline**.
- **"Economic"** is clearly associated with **financial gains**, reinforcing the link to **cost-benefit analysis**.
- **"Operational"** aligns naturally with **effectiveness and usability**, central to operational success.
- **"Technical"** connects with **technology and resource availability**, the core of technical feasibility.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This experience is now added to my personal toolkit of technical problem-solving strategies. Recognizing embedded clues within a problem's phrasing is a method I will continue to develop and apply systematically.
