# üìì Professional Journal ‚Äì Data Analysis Bootcamp  
**Skilling Center TecMilenio**

This folder contains a structured, session-by-session journal of my academic and technical development throughout the Data Analysis Bootcamp. Each entry documents not only the class content, but also personal reflections, detailed breakdowns, tools used, code practice, and critical takeaways.

The purpose is to build a transparent, traceable record of my growth in core data-related competencies‚Äîincluding statistics, databases, machine learning foundations, and professional workflow habits. This journal is part of my broader preparation for admission into top-tier institutions such as MIT or Harvard.

## üß† Author‚Äôs Note

I am a non-traditional student building a path toward elite academic and professional goals through focused, self-paced excellence. This repository is a reflection of deep commitment, clarity of vision, and the methodical acquisition of world-class technical knowledge.

My target is not to meet minimum standards‚Äîbut to exceed expectations and build evidence of top-tier discipline, problem-solving, and initiative.
