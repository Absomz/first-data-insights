## 📚 Content Covered – Week 1 / Class 1

### 📌 Main Topic: Introduction to Statistics for Data Analysis

#### 1. What is the difference between probability and statistics?

- **Probability**: from the population → deduces possible results (deductive reasoning)
- **Statistics**: from the sample → infers population features (inductive reasoning)
- 🏀 *Example*: bag of marbles (Gutman & Goldmeier):  
  In probability, I know the bag → predict the marble.  
  In statistics, I draw a marble → try to infer what the bag is like.

#### 2. Why is statistics important?

- Enables evidence-based decision making in uncertainty (politics, health, finance)
- ✨ *Key examples*:
  - **Casino**: games are designed statistically to ensure long-term gain
  - **Elections**: predictions based on small samples → risk of bias or misinterpretation

#### 3. Relationship to Data Science and Machine Learning

- **Statistics** = core language of Data Science
- **Data Analysis** = practical application to real-world data
- **Machine Learning** = automation of statistically supported decisions
- 🧩 Diagram reviewed:
  ```
  Data Science = AI + Machine Learning + Probability & Statistics + Business
  ```

## 🌟 Class Objectives – *Extended with technical examples*

### ✅ 1. Accurately distinguish between Probability and Statistics

- **Probability** = deduction → applies when population is known
- **Statistics** = induction → used when only a sample is available
- 🎯 *Technical example*: Insurer predicting accidents
- 🔍 *Reflection*: In ML, the training set is a sample, and the model is applied to a future population

---

### ✅ 2. Understand the current relevance of statistics

- 🔁 Casino: full variable control
- 🔁 Elections: partial sampling, frequent errors
- 💡 *Professional insight*: statistics not only measures — it guides strategic decisions in uncertain settings

---

### ✅ 3. Relationship with data analysis and ML

- 🔍 *Example*: sales analysis
  - Statistics: data summary (mean, deviation, percentiles)
  - Analysis: segmentation, visualization, correlations
  - ML: future prediction with models (classification, regression)

## ❌ Key Errors Addressed

| In methodology | In deliverable |
|----------------|----------------|
| Using AI trends without technical basis | Focusing on dashboard visuals rather than problem-solving |

🔍 *Personal comment*: This class stresses that even the most advanced tech cannot salvage a poorly defined problem. The first step is always a good question.
