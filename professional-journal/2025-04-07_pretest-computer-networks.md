# ðŸ“˜ Reflection â€“ Pretest: Computer Networks  
**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Student:** Abner Soberon Martinez  

Today, I completed a pretest on computer networks as part of my preparation for the upcoming data science and network training program. Out of all the questions, I only missed two â€” and ironically, **both were cases where I had originally considered the correct answer but second-guessed myself.**

- On the **network topology** question, I initially thought it might be a *hybrid*, but selected *tree* because it matched the textbook definition. The system, however, accepted *hybrid* as correct.  
- On the **network authentication via certification** question, I leaned toward *security services*, but changed to *directory services* based on logic and deeper understanding. Again, the system was expecting *security services* as the answer.

These small missteps were not due to lack of knowledge, but rather to overthinking and lack of confidence in my initial intuition.

## âœ¨ What I Learned:
- My current level of understanding is solid and aligned with real-world concepts.
- Sometimes, especially in technical fields, **trusting my informed instincts** is just as important as the knowledge itself.
- This experience gave me proof that I'm not just memorizing â€” I'm actually thinking like someone whoâ€™s preparing to work in IT and product management.

I'm proud of my performance and even more motivated to keep learning.  
This is just the beginning of the journey.
