# ðŸ“˜ Reflection â€“ Pretest: Computer Networks  
**Date:** April 7, 2025  
**Student:** Abner Soberon Martinez  

Today, I completed a pretest on computer networks as part of my high school curriculum, in parallel to my independent preparation for a future data science program. While the pretest is not directly connected to my upcoming data science training, it contributes meaningfully to my foundational understanding of networks. Out of all the questions, I only missed two â€” and ironically, both were cases where I had originally considered the correct answer but second-guessed myself.

On the network topology question, I initially thought it might be a hybrid, but selected tree because it matched the textbook definition. The system, however, accepted hybrid as correct.

On the network authentication via certification question, I initially considered security services based on logic, but then changed my answer to directory services after reading the provided material. Ironically, the system accepted security services â€” which matched my original instinct â€” as the correct answer.

These small missteps were not due to lack of knowledge, but rather to overthinking and lack of confidence in my initial intuition.

## âœ¨ What I Learned:
- My current level of understanding is solid and aligned with real-world concepts.
- Sometimes, especially in technical fields, **trusting my informed instincts** is just as important as the knowledge itself.
- This experience gave me proof that I'm not just memorizing â€” I'm actually thinking like someone whoâ€™s preparing to work in IT and product management.

I'm proud of my performance and even more motivated to keep learning.  
This is just the beginning of the journey.
