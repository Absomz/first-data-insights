# 🧠 MIT Roadmap - Abner Soberon

## 🎓 9th Grade (Current, expected completion: 2025)
- ✅ Accelerate to Algebra I  
- ✅ Physics  
- ✅ Accelerate to English 9  
- ✅ Foundations of Programming  
- ✅ Principles of Information Technology  
- ✅ Information Technology Applications  

🧩 **9th Grade Strategy:**  
This year was carefully designed as a foundational platform. I started with Accelerated Algebra I to pave the way toward Pre-Calculus and AP Calculus in future grades. 
Completing Physics in 9th grade is an advanced move that not only stands out but gives me a strong advantage for tackling AP Physics with confidence. 
The technology courses (Programming and IT) were chosen to develop logical thinking early on, preparing me for more advanced computer science in the future. 
This technical, mathematical, and scientific base puts me ahead of the average student.

## 📘 Planned 10th Grade (2025–2026)
- 📝 English II  
- ➕ Algebra II  
- 📐 Pre-Calculus  
- 🌍 World History  
- 🏛 U.S. Government and Politics (AP)  
- ⚛️ AP Physics  

🧩 **10th Grade Strategy:**  
This year marks the transition into advanced coursework. 
I chose to take Pre-Calculus here to ensure a solid grasp of functions and mathematical logic before Calculus AB. 
AP Physics is placed right after my foundation in Physics, leveraging my existing background. 
Including AP Government adds a critical reading and argumentation dimension without overwhelming the schedule. 
The balance between hard sciences, humanities, and logic is deliberate: it’s a challenging year, but well-structured for growth without overload.

## 📗 Planned 11th Grade (2026–2027)
- 📝 English III  
- 🔢 Integrated Math III  
- 📊 Probability and Statistics  
- 🧬 Biology  
- ➕ Calculus AB (AP)  
- 💻 AP Computer Science A  

🧩 **11th Grade Strategy:**  
This is my STEM consolidation year. 
Calculus AB and AP Computer Science A are the technical core that will define my college preparation. 
Since I already have strong foundations in math and programming, this is the perfect time to take them. 
Biology is a subject I already mastered in the past, so it serves as a moderate-load course that frees energy for the more demanding ones. 
Probability and Stats add a complementary focus useful for machine learning and data analysis, aligned with my future in AI. 
This year elevates my academic profile without exceeding my realistic capacity.

## 📙 Planned 12th Grade (2027–2028)
- 📝 English IV  
- 🏛 United States History  
- 🧪 Chemistry  
- ➕ Calculus BC (AP)  
- 📊 AP Statistics  
- 💰 Economics with Financial Literacy  

🧩 **12th Grade Strategy:**  
Final year, maximum impact without burnout. 
Calculus BC is placed here to build upon my previous mastery in AB. 
AP Statistics, which was foreshadowed by Probability & Stats, strengthens my quantitative profile. 
Chemistry appears here after Physics and Biology, completing the essential STEM science trio. 
English IV and US History strengthen my expression, analytical reading, and cultural context. 
Lastly, Economics brings critical financial thinking, valuable for both personal life and future innovation or leadership roles. 
This combination leaves me fully prepared to apply to elite universities with a comprehensive, strong, and competitive academic record.
