# 📊 Data Analysis Program – Personal Repository

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository created to document, organize, and demonstrate everything I will learn and build during my 6-month intensive Data Analysis program using Python and R. This repository is structured with clarity and purpose to reflect professional standards for project documentation, development, and reproducibility.

**Author:** Abner Soberón  
**Professional Goal:** To build a solid and well-documented portfolio as part of my long-term preparation to become a Technical AI Product Manager, with strong foundations in data science, artificial intelligence, and product thinking.
