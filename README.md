# 📊 Data Analysis Program – Personal Repository

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository created to document, organize, and demonstrate everything I will learn and build during my 6-month intensive Data Analysis program using Python and R. This repository is structured with clarity and purpose to reflect professional standards for project documentation, development, and reproducibility.

## 📁 Repository Structure Overview

### 🧪 `notebooks/`
Main directory to store all Jupyter Notebooks created during the course.

#### Subfolders:
- `01_sql/` - SQL and NoSQL queries, relational and non-relational databases.
- `02_r/` - Data analysis and statistical modeling with R.
- `03_data_processing_python/` - Python scripts and notebooks for data acquisition, transformation, and cleaning.
- `04_data_analysis_python/` - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizations, metrics and descriptive analysis.
- `05_machine_learning/` - Regression, classification, clustering, and neural network model notebooks.

---

### ⚙️ `scripts/`
Reusable Python scripts and modular code to support automation and analysis.

#### Subfolders:
- `data_cleaning/` - Scripts for raw data preparation, missing values, outlier handling.
- `data_transformation/` - Data reshaping, joins, aggregations, formatting.
- `automation/` - API calls, automated data loading, file manipulation scripts.
- `ml_helpers/` - Functions to train, evaluate and visualize machine learning models.
- `utils/` - Generic helper functions (e.g., logging, I/O operations, configuration management).

---

### 📂 `data/`
Central hub for all datasets used in the course.

#### Subfolders:
- `raw/` - Unprocessed datasets as originally retrieved (CSV, JSON, SQL dumps, API responses).
- `processed/` - Cleaned and transformed versions of raw datasets, ready for use.
- `synthetic/` - Artificial datasets generated for testing, experimentation, or illustration.
- `final/` - Final datasets used in reports, presentations, or model training.

---

### 🖼️ `images/`
All visual outputs related to data analysis.

#### Subfolders:
- `charts/` - PNG/JPG/WEBP image exports of graphs and plots from Jupyter Notebooks.
- `dashboards/` - Screenshots or exported images of dashboards built with external tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

---

### 📝 `reports/`
Documentation and interpretation of analytical work and insights.

#### Subfolders:
- `module_summaries/` - Notes and key takeaways at the end of each module.
- `project_reports/` - Detailed write-ups for complete projects including methodology and conclusions.
- `insights/` - Observations, findings, and data-driven narratives from notebooks or experiments.

---

### 📚 `references/`
Curated learning material and external documentation.

#### Subfolders:
- `python/` - Python-specific references, cheatsheets, guides, tutorials.
- `r/` - R-related references, statistical concepts, visualization tools.
- `sql/` - SQL language documentation, optimization tips, relational theory.
- `ml/` - Machine learning theory, algorithm explanations, research papers.
- `general/` - General data science or analysis resources not specific to one tool/language.

---

### 💡 `project-drafts/`
Sandbox for experimenting with new project ideas or working on assignments.

#### Subfolders:
- `ideas/` - Notes, outlines, and brainstorming ideas for upcoming projects.
- `experiments/` - Early-stage prototypes, draft notebooks, and testing of workflows or models.
